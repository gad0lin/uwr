1. Warm up - 4 pools
2. Sprint - 4 x hp on surface swim the and hp dive diagonally to the bottom corner and wait for signal to go to surface. Last pool wait for signal and swim to the other side underwater.

## Training with goals:

Durations: 15 mins.

Split in two teams:

1. Defending team: 2 goalies and 2 defenders with rotations.
2. Attacking team at least 2 attackers.

# Session 2

It is important to warm up before doing sprints.

## Warmup
* 2 lengths line dives + 2 sets of 4 lengths swimming * 8 half under, half over (huho) as the minimum warm up. One could also ask everyone to do the first 2 huhos slow, then medium, then fast, and slow again.

* In sprinting acceleration is the most important thing.
* do to do half pool sprints and not the full length. I think the full length is only useful if you have two players competing against each other.

Some sprint exercises we did are:
- Everybody starts on the first line, sprints to center, slowly dives the rest, swim back; repeat 4 times
- Everybody starts on the first line, sprints to center, waits for 5, 10, 15s, sprints the rest, swim back; repeat 4 times.
- 1 on 1 sprints side to side. Be sure to makes somewhat equal match ups and challenge players to be competitive (if you kick of the wall properly, there should be no reason to lose the other player before you reach the center of the pool).
- Half pool sprints with ball. Make groups of 5, have two players on the starting side, two in the center, and one on the other side.
- Passing and sprinting. This gets exhausting really fast.


# Session 3

No fins:
* Warmup 2 lengths dive to the bottom and touch the line
* Legs only - 4 pools
* 4 lengths - one way: dive and swim on the bottom and come back on surface
* Split into teams of three, each groups has a ball, 2 people are underwater and one is on surface, then one person goes up and person from the surface goes down - 4 lenghts.

Fins:
* 4 lenghts warm up
* 4 lengths - one way: diw and swim on the bottom and come back on surface
* 2 lengths passes in groups of three (as in exercise without fins)

Practice scoring from behind. Person with the ball goes under goalie and takes defender positions and pushed goalie with one hand why putting ball inside the basket with second hand. 


# Session 4

* 8 lengths: half pool on the surface and half underwater passing

* Split into groups of 4 people. Practice getting the ball from grip under arm. One hand catches elbow and second pushes the ball under arm.
* One person on the surface has the ball and two people work to get it out. As person holding a ball you might catch one of the attacter and use him/her as a shield from the second one.
